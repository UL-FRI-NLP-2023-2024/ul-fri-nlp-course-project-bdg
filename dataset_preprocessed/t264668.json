Pridem domov, vstavim... In stvar ne dela... Na cd-ju so wma datoteke, nekaj dll, exe...  Kako lahko spravim ta CD v pogon? A obstaja kak software, ki predvaja CD kot navadni cd predvajalniki (verjetno bi tam cd delal brez težav?)?   Hvala, lp."

Potem sem po naslednjem rebootu ročno pobrisal vso navlako , ki se je namestila v OS (mapo windows\\system ) (še dobro da sem pognal regsnap pred in po namestitvi) in potem zripal cd v mp3 z nerotom (save tracks) in ga prerezal z alfa nožem.  Nasvet : nikoli ne nameščaj nekaj v \"tri krasne\" za audio cdje.  Za kateri cd gre ? Kateri datoteke so na cdju (exe, dll , wma ) ?  Dela cd v hifi stolpu/cd predvajalniku v radiju ?"

CDS Player {Français} {Deutsch} {Italiano} {Espańol}  This CD contains protected audio files. You can play them directly from the CD using Macrovision's CDS Player, which opens automatically when you insert the CD into a drive on your computer.  Alternatively, you can copy the files to the Media Library on your computer and play them using Windows Media Player 7.1 or later.  Macrovision recommends that you use the latest version of Windows Media Player. You can download it free of charge from: {[http://windowsmedia.com/download/]}  Windows Media Player requires Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows 2000, Windows XP or later.  Playing a new CD  The first time you insert a CD into your computer, CDS Player may display a license agreement for it. If it does, you must click the INSTALL LICENSE button to copy the license onto your computer.  Your license will be stored on your computer, so you will not need to do this again.  The license agreement explains how you can use the CD. For more information, see {Understanding your Music Rights}.  Note: Your CD has been designed to start automatically when you insert it into your CD drive. This process is known as Autorun. If your CD does not start automatically, Autorun may have been disabled on your PC. If this happens, you can start the CD as follows: 1. On the taskbar, click the Start button, and then click Run.  2. Click Browse  3. From the Look in drop-down menu, click the CD drive.  4. Double-click PlayCDS.exe.  5. From the Run box, click OK.  Using CDS Player  The first time you use CDS Player, you may see a button labeled GET FLASH on the right side of the button bar. If you see this button, it means that Macromedia Flash Player 6 (or later) is not installed on your computer. Flash is a free plug-in for your browser and if your computer is connected to the Internet, Macrovision recommends that you click GET FLASH to install Flash.  Note: If you have Windows 2000 or Windows XP, you need to be logged on as a member of the Administrators group to install Flash.  Close  Click the Close button to close CDS Player. If you click the Windows Media Player button before closing CDS Player, you can close CDS Player without interrupting any music that is playing.  Minimize  Click the Minimize button to shrink CDS Player to an icon on the taskbar. You can continue listening to music while it is minimized.  Help  Click the Help button to open this document.  Windows Media Player  Click the Windows Media Player button to start Windows Media Player. You can use Windows Media Player or CDS Player to play your CD. There is no difference in the sound quality.  PLAYLIST  Click the PLAYLIST button to display or hide the list of tracks (playlist) for your CD. When the playlist is showing, you can click on a track to play it.  COPY ALBUM  Click the COPY ALBUM button to copy your music files from the CD to the Media Library on your computer. You can then use Windows Media Player to play your music at any time without needing to insert the CD into your computer.  The files are copied to the location set in Windows Media Player. To change this location: 1. Start Windows Media Player.  2. From the Tools menu, choose Options.  3. Select the Copy Music tab.  4. Click Change.  5. Browse to the folder where you want to store your music.  To play the files at any time, without the CD in the drive, open Windows Media Player and click the Media Library tab. Select your album and click on a track.  WEB LINK  If your CD has a Web page, a WEB LINK button appears in CDS Player. If you are connected to the Internet, you can click this button to display this Web page, which may contain photos, lyrics, and news about the artists featured on your CD.  EXTRAS  Some CDs contain extra (or \"bonus\") content that you can play on your computer. If your CD has extra content, the EXTRAS button appears on the toolbar. You can click this button to play the extra content on your CD.  The extra content may contain additional music and multimedia items relating to your CD.  Playback Controls  The Playback controls are displayed at the bottom of the CDS Player window. They are identical to the playback controls in Windows Media Player. The following table explains the function of each control. Play button — Play a selected track. When an item is playing, the Play button becomes the Pause button.  Pause button — Pause the track that is playing. To resume play, click the Play button. When a track is not playing (that is, it is either paused or stopped), the Pause button becomes the Play button.  Stop button — Stop playing a selected track.  Seek slider — Play a track at a specific point. The Seek slider indicates the playback progress of a selected track. You can drag the slider to any place in the selected track to continue playing from that point. Alternatively, if you click on any point in the track, the slider will jump to that point and continue playing from there.  Mute button — Turn the sound on or off.  Volume slider — Control the volume level.  Previous button — Play the previous track.  Next button — Play the next track.   You can display the name of a control by pausing your mouse pointer over the control.  If you use Windows Media Player Version 9.0 or later, the playback controls are synchronised between Windows Media Player and CDS Player. So, when you have both players open, if you adjust the volume slider in one player, it automatically adjusts in the other player.  Understanding your Music Rights  The files on this CD are protected with a license to prevent illegal copying. The license agreement explains how you can use the files. For example, it specifies whether you can copy (or \"burn\") them to a CD or copy (or \"export\") them to a portable device. The terms of the license are specified by the company that produced the CD. You cannot play protected files without a license.  The following rules apply to licensed files: * You can play protected files as many times as you like. You are informed of the terms, if any, when you acquire the license. If you have questions about the license terms, contact the CD provider.  * You cannot copy and share licenses among different computers. If you copy a licensed file to another computer or give a copy of the file to another person, you or the other person will need to acquire a new license for that computer. This process starts automatically when you play the file on the new computer.  * You cannot burn licensed files to a CD or export them to a portable device unless the license allows it.  CDS Player does not install any active or executable software whatsoever on your computer, only a passive data file that serves as a license for the music. CDS Player does not and cannot collect, retain, or transmit any information whatsoever about your computer or people who use it.  Backing up and restoring your Licenses  You can back up your licenses to a floppy disk or a similar storage device. By default, Windows Media Player prompts you to back up all your licenses about two weeks after you acquire a new license. If you lose a license or if your hard disk becomes corrupted, you can restore your license from your backup. It is wise to back up your licenses before you reinstall or upgrade your operating system.  Alternatively, if you lose your license, you can always re-install it by re-inserting your original CD into a drive on your computer.  For full details about backing up and restoring your licenses, see the Help Topics for Windows Media Player.
