        "message": "If you have been finding it difficult to open your shiny little sphere for some routine maintenance, then take a quick read of the points below to help you along the way - it genuinely is a straightforward task and will be done in less than 40 seconds from start to finish (I have timed it!) once you follow these instructions:  Here are a couple of quick pointers once again: (remember to first remove the counter before you begin)  1. The quickest way is to lift the band slightly at exactly the points where there is no text - that is, at the junction of where the front and back text meets on both sides - there is just black space at these 2 points. (I'll get working on some images of this as soon as possible and add them to the site shortly to explain this better).  This will expose the 2 tiny screws on each side without you having to go to the bother to take the band off completely (to look for them in the first place!). Remove these and put them to one side.  Now, take the Powerball and put him into the vise with the jaws of the [vise] resting against these 'blank' areas on the band (where you have just removed the screws from).  Put the ball down into the vise so that the exact middle or 'equator' of the ball (for want of a better word!) is sitting snugly in the middle of the jaw surface. Gently close the vise to a point where the ball is now firmly supported. At this point, depending on what kind of a vise you have (ours is an old one and well worn!) it will literally take just an extra 1/2 turn to maybe a full turn (if the vise gearing is different to ours), and you will hear that 'pop' we are referring to!  In truth, if your vise is really different to ours, it doesn't matter, just turn the handle until you hear the 'pop' (if you break it then we will replace the broken part, so don't worry!). The material in your Powerball is extremely strong and will flex considerably before it breaks so don't worry about causing harm - you won't unless you are deliberatly setting out to crush the little guy in there!  Anyway, once you hear the pop, take him out and you will now be able to manually separate the 2 halves. If you are still not able to do this then take the ball, put it back in but this time turn it 90 degrees (so that now the middle of the text on both sides rests up against the vise jaws) and give only a gentle turn to the handle (perhaps 1/4 to a 1/2 turn) to bring it that 'final bit' where you will see the two halves physically come apart in the vise...and that's it!  Do the work required and when ready simply press the two halves together with your hands - it will 'snap' back together and your work is done! Again, we will try to add images on the site shortly, but you really should see the condition of our vise - it has definitely come from the 'dark ages' almost and if it can get the ball apart then any vise in the world should be able to do this simple task!"
