abstract = {This study highlights the potential of fine-tuned ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) for automatically scoring student written constructed responses using example assessment tasks in science education. The application of ChatGPT in research and academic fields has greatly enhanced productivity and efficiency. Recent studies on ChatGPT based on OpenAI's generative model GPT-3.5 proved its superiority in predicting the natural language with high accuracy and human-like responses. GPT-3.5 has been trained over enormous online language materials such as journals and Wikipedia; however, direct usage of pre-trained GPT-3.5 is insufficient for automatic scoring as students do not utilize the same language as journals or Wikipedia, and contextual information is required for accurate scoring. All of these imply that a fine-tuning of a domain-specific model using data for specific tasks can enhance model performance. In this study, we fine-tuned GPT-3.5 on six assessment tasks with a diverse dataset of middle-school and high-school student responses and expert scoring. The six tasks comprise two multi-label and four multi-class assessment tasks. We compare the performance of fine-tuned GPT-3.5 with the fine-tuned state-of-the-art Google's generated language model, BERT. The results show that in-domain training corpora constructed from science questions and responses for BERT achieved average accuracy = 0.838, SD = 0.069. GPT-3.5 shows a remarkable average increase (9.1%) in automatic scoring accuracy (mean = 9.15, SD = 0.042) for the six tasks, p =0.001 < 0.05. Specifically, for each of the two multi-label tasks (item 1 with 5 labels; item 2 with 10 labels), GPT-3.5 achieved significantly higher scoring accuracy than BERT across all the labels, with the second item achieving a 7.1% increase. The average scoring increase for the four multi-class items for GPT-3.5 was 10.6% compared to BERT. Our study confirmed the effectiveness of fine-tuned GPT-3.5 for automatic scoring of student responses on domain-specific data in education with high accuracy. We have released fine-tuned models for public use and community engagement.}

abstract = {Slavic languages pose a challenge to the researchers in the domain of dialogue technology. A relatively free word order with a large degree of inflection, such as conjugation of verbs, and declension of adjectives, pronouns, and nouns are exhibited by the Slavic languages, which has a significant impact on the size of lexical inventories that significantly complicate the design of dialogue systems. This article conducts an empirical study on the state-of-the-art dialogue systems within Slavic languages. Moreover, we review the existing models in recent dialogue systems, pinpoint the current main challenges and identify potential research directions of practical and intelligent systems within low-resourced languages.}
