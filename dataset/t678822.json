Razumem, da je vzrok \"Protection\" vendar vseeno prosim, če mi nekdo z izkušnjami razloži zakaj je tako.   \"For new sellers ebay-paypal will hold the money for 21 days. that means you can see the money in your paypal balance named \"Pending-Balance\" but you can not use the money. This is a policy to protect the buyer.\"   Jaz nisem več new seller (ali pač), zato me zanima, kako je s tem."
