But please bring your attention to read this message with sympathetic mind. My name is Malik L. TOURE the only child of (Late Chief) Mr. Soro TOURE from Abidjan Cote D'Ivoire. My father was the formal minister of importation and exportation of petroleum and mineral resources.

Furthermore, I would like to know about you and discuss investment issue with you. I wish to let you know that I will be interested to invest in your country under your managements. Nevertheless, I have inherited fund US$9.5 Million (Nine Million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollar) which my late father deposited in one of the investment banks before he died in a private hospital because of the poison which affected and damage his body system while my mother died when I was still a kid so I never knew my mother. My father told me in his hospital bed that it was because of his wealth that he was poisoned and even his own brothers wants him dead so he advise that I should seek for a foreigner where I will transfer this money. Now I'm alone in this strange world without a father, mother or guardians at my tender age.
