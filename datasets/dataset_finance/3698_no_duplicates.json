The\nAirbus A380 has been in the works since 1999 and has accumulated\n$13 billion in development costs, which gives Boeing a huge\nadvantage now that Airbus has committed to the older style tubular\naircraft for decades to come.\n....There are several big advantages to the blended wing design,\nthe most important being the lift to drag ratio which is expected\nto increase by an amazing 50%, with overall weight reduced by 25%,\nmaking it an estimated 33% more efficient than the A380, and making\nAirbus’s $13 billion dollar investment look pretty shaky.
