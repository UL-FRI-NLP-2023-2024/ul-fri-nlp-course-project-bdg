MADNESS:\nReal name: Aleksander(saso) justin\nHardcore since: 1995\nDj since: 1997\nStyle: Darkcore, Industrial hardcore, Early \n \nAleksander Sašo Justin aka Mr.Madness began his career at the age of 15 when he first heard the compilation Thunderdome. He immediately knew that this is the music he's been looking for his whole life, but he didn't know that it will become part of his life as well.He soon decided to try himself as a DJ, which was hard at that time since not many knew what hardcore music was in Slovenia. But soon his luck changed and he got a chance to prove himself in a small club. It was a success, so he decided to organize his own shows which paid off a few years later. With a few good contacts he began to write history as the first Slovenian hardcore DJ who performed in Austria, Germany, Hungary and Netherlands. His music is full of energy and technical \"know how\".You can hear anything from darkcore, industrial, aggressive mainstream, oldschool and even terror. Today he's well respected DJ,who gains new fans on every step.That's why they call him the godfather of Hardcore scene in Slovenia. He produced quite a few songs, best known is his \"This is madness\", who was issued in compilation \"Hardcore made in Germany\".\n \n=&gt; PROMO SET, MARCH 2009\nhttp://www.zshare.net/audio/5709497950750bd2/?x=29&y=42\n \nTracklist:\n1.Shadowland terrorists-Still standing strong \n2.Ruffneck & Sei2ure - Armorgeddon \n3.S'aphira-Maicaka \n4.Charly Lownoise & Mental Theo-Dj [censored] \n5.Bryan acardi-Methodz of madness \n6.Neophyte-recession(relic rmx) \n7.Tellurian - Guyver 2007 \n8.Tieum & dr.macabre-hatefull \n9.Endymion-Pussy Mf(proto x rmx) \n10.Dione - Born To Raise Hell \n11.Hellsystem - Pray \n12.Tieum-Vandalist \n13.Mr.Madness-This is madness \n14.The Extremist - Blow Your Mind \n15.Endymion-Chemical implant \n16.Ophidian & Ruffneck-Noisemaker \n17.Tieum ft.Proto-X-Mechanical sickness \n18.Angerfist-Yes \n19.Diss Reaction-Jiiieehaaaa \n20.Catkiller-Good vs.bad \n21.Proto-X-Loser \n22.SRB-Highway 666",
