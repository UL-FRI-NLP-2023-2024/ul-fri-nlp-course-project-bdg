Pathogen New to Science Found in Roundup Ready GM Crops?\n\nUSDA senior scientist sends &#8220;emergency&#8221; warning to US Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack on a new plant pathogen in Roundup Ready GM soybean and corn that may be responsible for high rates of infertility and spontaneous abortions in livestock Dr. Mae-Wan Ho\nPlease distribute widely and forward to your elected representatives\n\nFood Futures Now , *Organic *Sustainable *Fossil Fuel Free, How organic agriculture and localised food, and energy systems can potentially compensate for all greenhouse gas emissions due to human activities and free us from fossil fuels An open letter appeared on the Farm and Ranch Freedom Alliance founded and run by Judith McGeary to save family farms in the US [1, 2].  The letter, written by Don Huber, professor emeritus at Purdue University, to Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, warns of a pathogen &#8220;new to science&#8221; discovered by &#8220;a team of senior plant and animal scientists&#8221;. Huber says it should be treated as an &#8220;emergency&#8217;&#8217;, as it could result in &#8220;a collapse of US soy and corn export markets and significant disruption of domestic food and feed supplies.&#8221;\n\nThe letter appeared to have been written before Vilsack announced his decision to authorize unrestricted commercial planting of GM alfalfa on 1 February, in the hope of convincing the Secretary of Agriculture to impose a moratorium instead on deregulation of Roundup Ready (RR) crops.  \n\nThe new pathogen appears associated with serious pervasive diseases in plants - sudden death syndrome in soybean and Goss' wilt in corn &#8211; but its suspected effects on livestock is alarming.  Huber refers to &#8220;recent reports of infertility rates in dairy heifers of over 20%, and spontaneous abortions in cattle as high as 45%.&#8221;\n\nThis could be the worst nightmare of genetic engineering that some scientists including me have been warning for years [3] (see Genetic Engineering Dream or Nightmare, ISIS publication): the unintended creation of new pathogens through assisted horizontal gene transfer and recombination.\n\nHuber writes in closing: &#8220;I have studied plant pathogens for more than 50 years. We are now seeing an unprecedented trend of increasing plant and animal diseases and disorders. This pathogen may be instrumental to understanding and solving this problem. It deserves immediate attention with significant resources to avoid a general collapse of our critical agricultural infrastructure.&#8221;\n\nThe complete letter is reproduced below.\n\nDear Secretary Vilsack:\n\nA team of senior plant and animal scientists have recently brought to my attention the discovery of an electron microscopic pathogen that appears to significantly impact the health of plants, animals, and probably human beings. Based on a review of the data, it is widespread, very serious, and is in much higher concentrations in Roundup Ready (RR) soybeans and corn-suggesting a link with the RR gene or more likely the presence of Roundup. This organism appears NEW to science!\n\n This is highly sensitive information that could result in a collapse of US soy and corn export markets and significant disruption of domestic food and feed supplies. On the other hand, this new organism may already be responsible for significant harm (see below). My colleagues and I are therefore moving our investigation forward with speed and discretion, and seek assistance from the USDA and other entities to identify the pathogen's source, prevalence, implications, and remedies.\n\nWe are informing the USDA of our findings at this early stage, specifically due to your pending decision regarding approval of RR alfalfa. Naturally, if either the RR gene or Roundup itself is a promoter or co-factor of this pathogen, then such approval could be a calamity. Based on the current evidence, the only reasonable action at this time would be to delay deregulation at least until sufficient data has exonerated the RR system, if it does.\n\nFor the past 40 years, I have been a scientist in the professional and military agencies that evaluate and prepare for natural and manmade biological threats, including germ warfare and disease outbreaks. Based on this experience, I believe the threat we are facing from this pathogen is unique and of a high risk status. In layman's terms, it should be treated as an emergency.\n\nA diverse set of researchers working on this problem have contributed various pieces of the puzzle, which together presents the following disturbing scenario:\n\nUnique Physical Properties\nThis previously unknown organism is only visible under an electron microscope (36,000X), with an approximate size range equal to a medium size virus. It is able to reproduce and appears to be a micro-fungal-like organism. If so, it would be the first such micro-fungus ever identified. There is strong evidence that this infectious agent promotes diseases of both plants and mammals, which is very rare.\n\nPathogen Location and Concentration\nIt is found in high concentrations in Roundup Ready soybean meal and corn, distillers meal, fermentation feed products, pig stomach contents, and pig and cattle placentas.\n\nLinked with Outbreaks of Plant Disease\nThe organism is prolific in plants infected with two pervasive diseases that are driving down yields and farmer income-sudden death syndrome (SDS) in soy, and Goss' wilt in corn. The pathogen is also found in the fungal causative agent of SDS (Fusarium solani fsp glycines).\n\nImplicated in Animal Reproductive Failure\nLaboratory tests have confirmed the presence of this organism in a wide variety of livestock that have experienced spontaneous abortions and infertility. Preliminary results from ongoing research have also been able to reproduce abortions in a clinical setting.\n\nThe pathogen may explain the escalating frequency of infertility and spontaneous abortions over the past few years in US cattle, dairy, swine, and horse operations. These include recent reports of infertility rates in dairy heifers of over 20%, and spontaneous abortions in cattle as high as 45%.\n\n For example, 450 of 1,000 pregnant heifers fed wheatlege experienced spontaneous abortions. Over the same period, another 1,000 heifers from the same herd that were raised on hay had no abortions. High concentrations of the pathogen were confirmed on the wheatlege, which likely had been under weed management using glyphosate.\n\nRecommendations\nIn summary, because of the high titer of this new animal pathogen in Roundup Ready crops, and its association with plant and animal diseases that are reaching epidemic proportions, we request USDA's participation in a multi-agency investigation, and an immediate moratorium on the deregulation of RR crops until the causal/predisposing relationship with glyphosate and/or RR plants can be ruled out as a threat to crop and animal production and human health.\n\nIt is urgent to examine whether the side-effects of glyphosate use may have facilitated the growth of this pathogen, or allowed it to cause greater harm to weakened plant and animal hosts. It is well-documented that glyphosate promotes soil pathogens and is already implicated with the increase of more than 40 plant diseases; it dismantles plant defenses by chelating vital nutrients; and it reduces the bioavailability of nutrients in feed, which in turn can cause animal disorders. To properly evaluate these factors, we request access to the relevant USDA data.\n\nI have studied plant pathogens for more than 50 years. We are now seeing an unprecedented trend of increasing plant and animal diseases and disorders. This pathogen may be instrumental to understanding and solving this problem. It deserves immediate attention with significant resources to avoid a general collapse of our critical agricultural infrastructure.\n\nSincerely,\n\nCOL (Ret.) Don M.

Huber called for an emergency investigation, and for USDA to stop deregulating Roundup Ready crops.\n\nBut the Purdue article challenges some of the claims that Huber, a longtime critic of biotech crops, made in his letter, particularly his assertions about plant disease and decreased crop yields. Some of the same scientists have disagreed with Huber before. Last year, following an article based on an interview with Huber, they wrote, \"In our opinion the doomsday scenario painted by this article is greatly exaggerated.\"\n\nSome of the Purdue scientists' latest key points:\n\n&#61550; Although herbicides, such as glyphosate, have the potential to increase disease in certain plants, plant pathologists have not observed a widespread increase in susceptibility to plant diseases in glyphosate-resistant corn and soybean.\n\n&#61550; The claim that plant disease has \"skyrocketed' due to glyphosate use is unfounded.\n\n&#61550; Very few pathogens infect both plants and animals, and while fungi in the genus Fusarium can produce mycotoxins that can be harmful to animals and humans, the majority of Fusarium fungi are pathogens of corn and wheat. Wheat and food-grade corn are non-GMO crops, meaning that mycotoxin development in these crops would not be directly linked to glyphosate use or interactions.\n\n&#61550; Overall, claims that glyphosate is having a widespread effect on plant health are largely unsubstantiated.\n\nThe authors conclude by reaffirming their recommendation of judicious glyphosate use for weed control, adding,  \"We encourage crop producers, agribusiness personal, and the general public to speak with University Extension personnel before making changes in crop production practices that are based on sensationalist claims instead of facts.\"",
