More importantly you have to have a keen interest in animals and conservation in general. Any experience you have with animals will help your application so please ensure you add this to your application. The project will only last for the duration of one month at time. You may be able to extend this while in Kenya, but this is at the discretion of the project and the KWS.  Although Travellers’ will try to place a two or more volunteers on the same project at the same time; there may be times where the project itself will dictate that only one volunteer can work on a specific project, but there will be local staff on that project. If you're the type of person who won't be comfortable with that, we will endeavour to ensure that you're kept with other volunteers. ",
